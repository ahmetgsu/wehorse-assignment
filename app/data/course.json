        "courseDescription": "<p>The age-appropriate basic training of a young horse is the basis for developing a reliable, confident riding horse. It is important to encourage young horses without overtaxing them. In this course, riding master Klaus Balkenhol, gives you a unique insight into his method of age-appropriate horse training according to the dressage training scale.</p>\r\n<p>It takes about 2 years to establish the foundation training of a young horse &ndash; even for extremely talented horses, like the 3-year-old stallion in the third part of the course. The riding master explains what you should pay attention to with such exceptional horses in order to prepare them for a long and successful career.</p>\r\n<p>Classical horse training is all about consolidating trust in the rider and building up the muscles that are important for riding. Klaus Balkenhol shows the muscle development he looks for and helps you recognize whether the hindquarters are active.</p>\r\n<p>Young horses can quickly become worried in unfamiliar situations. Like the 5-year-old, His Highness, who in the sixth part of the course is frightened by loud music in the warm-up arena. Klaus Balkenhol comments on this scenario and explains how you can solve such moments in a horse-friendly way.&nbsp;</p>",
